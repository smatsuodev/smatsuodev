# Markdown Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, museum-quality GitHub profile READMEs and markdown documents that transcend generic templates. Craft markdown as a visual medium with exceptional attention to aesthetic details, typographic choices, and compositional balance.

The user provides markdown requirements: a GitHub profile README, portfolio section, project showcase, or documentation page. They may include context about personal brand, technical focus, or aesthetic preferences.

## Design Philosophy Creation

Before writing markdown, establish a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY for the document:

**Name the aesthetic direction** (1-2 words): "Terminal Elegance" / "Geometric Precision" / "Organic Flow" / "Brutalist Code" / "Minimalist Craft"

**Articulate the philosophy** through:
- **Spatial Rhythm**: How negative space, section breaks, and visual breathing room create hierarchy
- **Typographic Voice**: How headers, emphasis, and text treatments express personality
- **Visual Language**: How badges, icons, stats, and decorative elements form a cohesive system
- **Compositional Balance**: How asymmetry, alignment, and flow guide the reader's eye
- **Craftsmanship**: Every element must appear meticulously placed, as if labored over for hours

**CRITICAL**: The final work must look like it took countless hours to create—the product of someone at the absolute top of their field with painstaking attention to every detail.

## Design Thinking

Understand context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What impression should this README create? What story does it tell?
- **Audience**: Who visits this profile? Recruiters, collaborators, open-source community?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme—brutally minimal, maximalist showcase, retro-terminal, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/creative, editorial/magazine, geometric/precise, soft/approachable, industrial/utilitarian
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Markdown Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography & Text Treatments

- **Headers**: Use hierarchy intentionally. Mix `#` levels with purpose. Consider decorative separators.
- **Emphasis**: Strategic use of **bold**, *italics*, and `inline code` as visual accents
- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for visual emphasis, philosophical statements, or highlighted content
- **Lists**: Curated bullet points with consistent rhythm. Avoid walls of undifferentiated items.

### Visual Elements (GitHub-Compatible)

- **Badges**: Curate thoughtfully—quality over quantity. Group by category. Use shields.io with consistent styling (flat, flat-square, for-the-badge, plastic). Custom colors matching the overall palette.
- **GitHub Stats Cards**: Integrate github-readme-stats, streak-stats, or trophy displays. Customize themes to match aesthetic direction.
- **Icons & Emojis**: Use sparingly as visual anchors. Consistent style (outline vs filled). Consider emoji as typographic elements.
- **Dividers**: Creative separators using `---`, decorative ASCII, or subtle patterns
- **Images & GIFs**: Header banners, animated elements, or visual showcases. Ensure they serve the narrative.

### Spatial Composition

- **Negative Space**: Generous breathing room between sections. Dense content feels overwhelming.
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned text is readable. Centered elements create visual anchors.
- **Flow**: Guide the eye through intentional section ordering
- **Grid Thinking**: Use HTML tables for multi-column layouts when pure markdown falls short

### Color & Theme Coherence

- **Badge Palettes**: Consistent color families across all shields.io badges
- **Stats Themes**: Match card themes (dark, radical, tokyonight, etc.) to overall aesthetic
- **Contrast**: Dark mode and light mode considerations—GitHub respects prefers-color-scheme

### Advanced Techniques

- **HTML Integration**: `<div align="center">`, `<img>` with sizing, `<details>` for collapsibles
- **ASCII Art**: Minimal, tasteful use for personality without overwhelming
- **Animated Elements**: Typing SVGs, animated stats, or subtle GIF accents
- **Tables**: Clean data presentation with consistent formatting

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

NEVER create generic markdown with these hallmarks of "AI slop":

- Overused badge walls without curation or visual hierarchy
- Default shields.io colors without customization
- Cookie-cutter section ordering (About → Skills → Projects → Contact)
- Generic greetings ("👋 Hi there, I'm...")
- Walls of undifferentiated text or bullet points
- Mismatched visual styles (mixing badge types, inconsistent icons)
- Cluttered layouts without breathing room
- Templates that could belong to anyone

## Craftsmanship Mandate

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.

- **Maximalist designs**: Elaborate layouts, custom badges, animated elements, layered visual systems
- **Minimalist designs**: Restraint, precision, careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details

Elegance comes from executing the vision well. Every element must be placed with the precision of a master craftsman.

## Output Format

Produce markdown that:
1. Renders beautifully on GitHub's markdown parser
2. Works in both dark and light mode
3. Is cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
4. Feels genuinely designed for the individual's personal brand
5. Could be shown as evidence of design expertise

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Push beyond convention, commit fully to a distinctive vision, and create something that proves markdown can be an art form.
